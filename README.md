# Unity-SolarSystem by Franco Vega (frankvega)
## Unity Project for College Assigment
#

The objective is to make a working simple solar system using Unity's main tools. This is our first time using the software but as time progresses we will be doing more complex stuff.

Since there is no build version for the project, you will have to download the repo yourself and open the Unity Project on your desired computer.

Enjoy!
